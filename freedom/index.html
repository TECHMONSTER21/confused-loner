<h1>Freedom</h1>
<p>
    Freedom seems meagre<br>
    Slavery feels so great<br>
    For what i always  fought for was freedom<br>
    Slave to the very idea of freedom<br>
    Free to be a slave<br>
    What price does a petal pay to be free<br>
    What price does a cadet pay<br>
    To be free from the shackles of maternal bond<br>
    For everything comes with a price<br>
    Price which has to be paid to almighty<br>
    Mystery is to me this conundrum<br>
    What price does i have to pay?<br>
    Inorder to become that Price.
