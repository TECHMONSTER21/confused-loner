<p>
    It goes without saying<br>
    Pain is a tender touch of virtue<br>
    Hope had the entirety of humanity slaying<br>
    Then comes the love,dawn of a deadly
</p>
<p>
    Some call it lust<br>
    Some call it love<br>
    I call it You<br>
    You are my "lust for  life"
</p>
<p>
    Bubbles were my loved ones<br>
    Maybe i am just an echo of those ruptures<br>
    You, a final question to my destiny riddled life<br>
    Are as well as the answer to it,giving it a utter purpose.
