<h1>Moon</h1>
<p>
    Slowly subdues the pater of grim reaper his duty<br>
    Quickly rises the selene in sky as if she is hell's bounty<br>
    Little she looks ill at ease<br>
    Exquisite her scars look just as if they live with her at peace<br>
    Limelight are that glinting mob of stars<br>
    Unvieling the arena of immaculate darkness at which she chuckles<br>
    Envious must be the cupid of her darts of soft ambrosia rays<br>
    Swarmed her radiance the entire stage like a wildfire<br>
    Dawn of this bitter love is all her blunder<br>
    A real ambrosia of hope for a blue bard<br>
    There lies a dire facet of everything there ever will be<br>
    Fireflies toiling to transcend the celestial bodies<br>
    Clouds passes by as if to protect her from mortals<br>
    Cried loudly the curtain closers in fear of losing her<br>
    But was there a one who loved her the same in all her phases.
