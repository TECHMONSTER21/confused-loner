<h1>Healings</h1>
<p>
    Hide it behind yoyr still shadow space<br>
    Hide it behind your beautiful lies<br>
    For hiding reveals your iniquity<br>
    As dark as hue of all hue<br>
    As bright as infant's innocous leer<br>
    Fortunate i never did let you in my home<br>
    A home where the breadwinner is a vagant<br>
    Decimated by the ways of world<br>
    But a contract of debt is already made<br>
    For which i remorse<br>
    Let the curtains fall<br>
    Let the world believe that the play is over<br>
    Immune is the play to it's playwright<br>
    For the playwright is me since it's inception.
