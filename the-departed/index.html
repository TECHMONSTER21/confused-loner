<h1>The Departed</h1>
<p>Too much to bear<br>
   Too much, I swear<br>
   What is this peculiar gleam on my face<br>
   Or am i a slave to a grave<br>
   A grave full of eternal love<br>
   For the grave is not of my departed Half<br>
   My own,<br>
   Those Imploring eyes begging for Revival on my behalf.
