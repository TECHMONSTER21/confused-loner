<h1>Lost-1</h1>
<p>
    Those pearly eyes I stare at<br>
    As if i was the parasite<br>
    For which her Nacre was created<br>
</p>
<p>
    Trivial was my toil<br>
    When the winner was her smile<br>
    Never felt a forfeit so euphoric.
</p>
<p>
    An incarnation of psyche<br>
    Little do i know her name<br>
    Wanted to carol until we blend
</p>
<p>
    Must be another cliche that i got lost<br>
    Just to be found again lost n her thoughts
